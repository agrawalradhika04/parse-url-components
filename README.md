# parse-url-components
This program takes a user-supplied URL as input and breaks it down into its fundamental components: the protocol, server, account name, and file path. The program identifies each part by using string parsing methods such as find, substr, and rfind, allowing users to clearly understand the structure of a URL.

In addition to the core components, the program also extracts the file name at the end of the URL using the rfind method, providing a complete breakdown of the web address. This helps illustrate how web browsers and servers interpret various parts of a URL when accessing online resources.
